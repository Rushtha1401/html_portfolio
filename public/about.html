<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an enthusiastic and curious Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student at Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology (SKCET), with a strong interest in software development and backend technologies.</p>

<p>Even though my academic background is in ECE, I've built a solid foundation in Java, Spring Boot, Spring Core, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and Maven. I enjoy developing backend applications, working with databases like H2, and creating RESTful APIs. I'm also experienced with tools like Git, GitHub, and VS Code.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about combining my engineering mindset with programming skills to solve real-world problems. I'm always eager to learn, build meaningful projects, and grow as a developer in the tech world.</p>
